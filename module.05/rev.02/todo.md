## Todo List

### Phase 1: Analyze project materials and understand requirements
- [ ] Read the provided Jupyter notebooks to understand the content and identify key findings.
- [ ] Review the PowerPoint template and the grading criteria to ensure all requirements are met.

### Phase 2: Extract key findings and insights from notebooks
- [x] Manually extract and execute relevant code snippets from each notebook to gather data, generate visualizations, and identify key findings.
- [x] Manually extract SQL queries and their expected outputs from `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb` and summarize the findings.
- [x] Summarize the methodologies and results from each notebook, focusing on the technical details required for the peer audience.

### Phase 3: Create presentation structure and content
- [x] Based on the grading criteria, outline the presentation structure, including all required slides (Executive Summary, Introduction, Data Collection, EDA, Predictive Analysis, Conclusion, etc.).
- [x] Draft the content for each slide, incorporating the technical details and insights extracted from the notebooks.
- [x] Create the HTML files for each slide with appropriate styling and content.

### Phase 4: Generate supporting visualizations and assets
- [x] Recreate or extract high-quality versions of charts, tables, and interactive elements (e.g., Folium maps, Plotly Dash components) from the notebooks.
- [x] Ensure all visualizations are properly integrated into the presentation slides.

### Phase 5: Build and finalize presentation slides
- [x] Use the provided PowerPoint template (or create a new one if necessary) to build the presentation slides.
- [x] Finalize the presentation with all required content and visualizations.
- [x] Ensure the presentation flows well and tells a compelling story of the data science journey.
- [x] Review the presentation against the grading criteria to ensure all points are covered.

### Phase 6: Convert to PDF and deliver final presentation
- [x] Convert the final PPTX presentation to PDF format.
- [x] Deliver the final presentation files to the user.
